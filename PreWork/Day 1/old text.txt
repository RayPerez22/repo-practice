Hi my name is Raymond. You can call me Ray for short. I'm a <br>Dominican-American born
            and raised in New York City. I have<br> a lot of interest
            in sports (e.g., Baseball, Baseketball and MMA).<br> I've been a sports fan my whole
            life. I've learned a lot of lessons <br>watching and also playing sports.
            My other interest are Video Games and Tv/Movies.
